      <p>
        The Timberline Trail, the poor (or impatient) man's Wonderland Trail. 3
        days circumnavigating Mount Hood with a climb up to 9000' on the Copper
        Spur.
      </p>
      <p>
        For some reason I approached this trail thinking it would be a chill and
        easy hike, with aboslutely no supporting data. If you more than quickly
        glance at the elevation profile of the route, you'll see that it's
        entirely up and down, crossing each ridge that extends out from the
        mountain, one after the other. There were literally zero flat sections
        of this 40 mile hike. I have paid for my arrogance.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am being slightly dramatic, it was definitely within my capabilites, I
        was just not mentally prepared for it.

        keeps for a while.

      <h2>Day 1</h2>
      <p>
        I drove about 4 hours down from Seattle the morning of the hike,
        starting at Timberline Lodge going CCW to avoid the sand climb at the
        end of the CW route. I didn't have much time to check out the lodge but
        it's clearly a very special historic place. Maybe another time.

      <h2>Day 2</h2>
      <p>
        The next day I aimed to climb Copper Spur and make it to the north side
        of the mountain. I had camped fairly close to the highest point on the
        loop at 7300'.
      </p>
      <img

        class="post-image"
        alt="20250927_085717.jpg"
      />
      <p>
        But from there my route wanted me to give back 800' to catch the
        junction to Copper Spur. I just started on a bearing toward it instead
        of giving back the elevation.

        A bit higher than the mapped location of the spur, there was a bivy spot
        with a register, and a nice monument.

      <p>
        At this point I am still just shy of 9000' feet, so I continue a bit
        further up. The environment starts to feel more alpine, as the ground
        starts to turn muddy from glacial run off, and falling rock becomes a
        hazard.

        A fine ridge walk back down to the Timberline Trail. I passed a lot of
        people on their way up on this Saturday morning, some with skis and
        snowboards even though there was hardly any snow.

        The North side of the mountain was the mildest section, traversing
        through alpine meadows and some intermittent burn areas.

      <p>I camped in Carin Basin near the shelter.</p>

        This MRE is halarious. It is the best tasting one by MILES and is
        consistently out of stock at REI, to the point where I would set an
        email alert for when it goes back in stock. I got the email and
        procrastinated, and after one hour they were gone again. I was lucky to
        find a few at the store in person a couple of days before.

      <h2>Day 3</h2>
      <p>
        I had already decided the day before that I was going to hike out on
        this day, and my decision was validated by heavy wildfire smoke that
        rolled in during the night. I had 18.5 miles to do this day, which would
        have been fine except that I overlooked the 4500' of elevation gain on
        the way out. Again, I need to stop skimming zoomed out elevation
        profiles.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started the day by hiking down 3000' feet, knowing that each step
        would be exchanged with another one in the other direction later.
      </p>

      <p>
        Time was not a concern but I knew this was going to be hard especially
        since I did 4000' yesterday. W/e challenge accepted.
      </p>
      <p>
        I did not take many pictures this day beacuse I was focused and it was
        mostly forests.

        I ate lunch at this waterfall I could not remember the name of. Dreading
        the 4000' ft ascent I was about to tackle after already hiking 12 miles,
        with no real reward at the end :((((.

      <p>
        I did get some nice views of the west side of the mountain on the
        ascent. A man told me the lodge had good food so I decided to use that
        as my motivation.

      <p>I was struggling at this point. Blisters and foot pain mainly.</p>

        Last pic before arriving at the lodge. In the end I ended up doing 20
        miles (missed a turn at one point), 4500' up and 4300' down, which is
        probably the most intense day I've ever done. I was exhausted but the
        foot pain was insane, likely due to new insoles. I think you're supposed
        to break those in slower than I did.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was passed by many trail runners doing the entire loop in a day. I
        guess I can suck it up.

        The lodge was very busy, I wondered how accomodating they were to people
        who smelled like me, but luckily I had a change of clothes in the car. I
        ate at the resturant on the top floor, had something called a BLAT,
        which was just a BLT with avocado, and some chili and a beer. Forgot to
        take a pic. The food was mediocre but the service was good and I sat
        near a window with a full view of the mountain.
      </p>
      <p>
        This route was interesting but I felt it was more work than was merited.
        I am definitely interested in the idea of trail running it once I am
        able, but the most likely reason I will be back here will be to climb
        Mount Hood. Til we meet again.
