        The next day I planned to climb Old Snowy Mountain and traverse the main
        Ridge as far as I could. I started out I think around 7AM, again with a
        very light pack with some essentials and lunch.

        Even with all my hatred for scree I took this alternate route up to the
        area I was in yesterday.

        My first look at the ridge beyond Old Snowy. Looks doable. (spoiler
        alert, it was).

        I ate a candy bar and got started with the ridge traverse. I heard this
        was Class 2 and 3 most of the way. I did not know how far I was going to
        go, but I had a light goal of summiting Ives Peak. I think in my videos
        I was calling this peak St Ives??? Not sure what happened there. I also
        really wanted to descend from the ridge and meet back up with the Lily
        Basin trail instead of backtracking.
      </p>
      <p>
        There was a light bootpath most of the way, with some more advanced
        route finding to avoid sketchy sections. The scrambling was a blast. I
        did not encounter anyone else on this ridge.

        I hung out at Ives for nearly an hour, ate lunch and chilled in my Crazy
        Creek chair (bless this thing).

      <p>
        Then headed down to the saddle where I made that video commenting on the
        insane Class 5 route. From there I headed west straight down the ridge
        toward the Lily Basin trail that was easily visible in the distance.

        Don't tell Mount Rainier but I think Mount Adams is prettier. No shade

        Now for some annoying logistics. I had to backtrack quite a bit to get
        to my camp. This would have been less annoying if I decided to end the
        day, but it was only 2pm and I figured I could hike out the next day,
        turning a 4 day trip into a 3 day. If I wanted to do this however, I
        would have had to do around 18 miles and then drive 3 hours home. I
        figured I could do some of those miles today since I still had time. So
        not only did I backtrack to my camp, I tore it down and rebacktracked
        back up to Snowgrass Flats to continue the loop. I would maybe recommend
        not doing this and actually doing some light planning, but whatever.
      </p>
      <p>
        The plus side of this is I got to eat day 3's dinner for lunch. I think
        it was Pad Thai and it was pretty good.

        Leaving the core area behind met back up with the PCT in Snowgrass Flats
        with a full pack. I was aiming to do at least 5 miles and camp somewhere
        around Nannie Peak. It was getting into the 80s at this point which made
        the whole backtracking process more of a slog.

        This section was stunning. The trail wrapped around a huge basin beneath
        the Goat Rocks ridge section beyond where I scrambled to. It looked like
        the Dolomites.

        The last day was an easy 10 miles descending Nannie Ridge and moving
        through the forests near Walrupt Lake. This was a major recreation area
        with car campsites and a big parking lot.

        From here, I had to ascend 1500' up to Berry Patch which was not fun.
        Trail was overgrown, steep, crossed roads, and the grand finale was
        walking about a mile down a dirt road in 85 degree heat, inhaling the
        dust kicked up by incoming Subarus. This was a Saturday so the trailhead
        was packed, with maybe a half mile long line of cars beyond the parking
        lot.

        I think it might be more fun to knock this section out downhill on the
        first day by doing the loop in the opposite direction.

        This region definitely exceeded my expectations. I will try to come back
        here next year to see the flowers in full bloom. I also saw online you
        can approach the ridge from the northeast so that might be a good way to
        hit the sections of the ridge that I missed and see the other side of
        it. This might be my favorite backpacking trip yet.
