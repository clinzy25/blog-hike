      <p>
        I figured it was time to see if the Enchantments could live up to the
        hype. I have successfully avoided spoilers of this region for several
        years, and through various interactions with people who described their
        experiences there, it has ascended to a sort of mythical status in my
        mind. I decided some time ago that I would not even venture to Colchuck
        lake until I was physically able to do the Traverse, ideally in the
        fall. I was copiously rewarded for my patience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since this trail is not a loop, I had planned (unaware of the shuttle
        service) to stash my bike at the terminus and ride it 8 miles back to
        the starting point. This is not what I did for reasons I will explain.
      </p>
      <p>
        I packed very light for this trip, expected temps in the high 30s to low
        50s. Everything to the right of the trekking poles in the pic below went
        with me. In retrospect I would have carried a full set of thermals in
        case of emergency at this time of year.

      <h2>The Approach</h2>
      <p>I started by headlamp from the Colchuck Lake trailhead at 4:30 am.</p>
      <img

      />
      <p>
        And arrived at Colchuck by around 7am. First time seeing Dragontail and
        Colchuck peaks, jaw on the floor, one of the most striking mountains I
        have ever seen. I hung out here for around a half hour waiting for a bit
        more light before tackling Asgaard.

        Once I got a little more daylight I started moving around the west side
        of Colchuck Lake in persuit of the infamous Asgaard Pass.

      <h2>Asgaard Pass</h2>
      <p>
        Asgaard Pass, the rite of passage to the Enchantments. 2200' from lake
        to top.
      </p>

      <p>
        I've heard and read many accounts of Asgaard. I think it is easy to both
        over and under-estimate it. While it was very long, steep, and
        unrelenting, it was not particularly technical or dangerous. I imagine
        being off route might change that, but I found the ascent to be not
        quite as bad as I thought it was going to be, while also being extremely
        hard. Not sure what you can do with that information.
      </p>
      <p>
        The routefinding was a bit challenging, but the general advice is to
        stay to the left of the stream and the trees. I encountered light snow
        and ice in the last 20% of the climb made it a bit sketchier. I slipped
        twice but was not injured.

      <h2>The Core</h2>
      <p>
        I try not to be hyperbolic, but for all the natural places I have been,
        this truly felt like stepping off of a ship and onto an alien world,
        like the game No Man's Sky. The landscape here is incredibly distict.

      <p>
        I'm not sure the English language is adequate to describe this area, and
        these images hardly do it justice, but this is essentially a high alpine
        basin with many small lakes that mostly consist of snowmelt. The upper
        basin you first encounter is treeless and very rugged. You then
        gradually descend into the lower basin where the vegitation thickens,
        passing lake after lake, each one somehow more picturesque than the one
        before. On all sides you are flanked by jagged peaks and ridglines most
        of which appear to have mild approaches. I was so jealous of the many
        backpackers I passed who had the obscene privilage of leisure, who no
        doubt were spending their days peak bagging, swimming, and exploring
        every corner of this region.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have since learned the success rate of backcountry permits for this
        region is about 6%. I am starting to understand the hype.

        I am now about halfway through the upper basin. I describe some
        logistical stuff in the video below. TLDR - Some trail runners I talked
        to mentioned that they usually turn around at Lake Viviane turning the
        tranverse into and out-and-back. I was starting to consider doing this
        as I was not looking forward to the bike ride at the end of the day.

        Here the landscape becomes a mix of rock, meadow, and shallow pools,
        dotted with clusters of larches. Unbelievable.

        Here I began to see a great deal of wildfire smoke wafting up from the
        lower basin :(

      <h2>Heading back</h2>
      <p>
        Here is where I decided to turn back and give up on the idea doing the
        whole traverse. Disappointing but I knew at this point the bike ride was
        not realistic and the smoke was not very inviting.

        Moving back now to the upper basin. I was to gain 1000' and then return
        like 6200' by the end of the day. I was not looking forward to
        descending Asgaard but it did sound better than an 8 mile bike ride up
        2000'.

        Saying goodbye to this alpine paradise. Til we meet again, and we surely

        I got back to the car around 530pm, clocking around 22 miles, and 6000'
        of gain and loss. I picked up my bike from snow lake, got a burrito from
        a taco truck in Leavenworth, and headed home.
      </p>
      <p>
        What a way to end the season. I will 110% be back here next year, permit
        or not. I have do conclude that the Enchantments do in fact live up to
        their reputation, and far exceed it.
