        Two years straight I have been smoked out of hiking around Mount Rainier
        in September. Not this year.
      </p>
      <p>
        For this trip I tried making my own granola breakfasts as I have been
        paying almost $10 each for the MREs, and the recipe is very basic. If
        you are interested:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Sturdy MRE bags like
          <a
            href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09DFPVF1F?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title"
            >this</a
          >. These are actually reusable and dishwasher safe.
        </li>
        <li>1 Cup any kind of granola</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of dry milk</li>
        <li>Dehydrated fruit. Trader Joe's has a good selection of these.</li>
        <li>Add cold water and stir when ready to eat.</li>
      </ul>

        The day before the hike I finished work around 2 PM, picked up a rental
        car and headed to Berry Patch Trailhead. If you are coming from the
        north, there is a 45 min long dirt road off of US12 with tons of rivets
        that unavoidably shake the shit out of your car. I arrived in the
        evening, ate some leftover pasta and crashed (slept) in my car.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started the next morning at 6:30AM with a swift ascent up to Goat
        Ridge Lookout. Barely 2 miles into this hike you start to get some
        awesome views.

        Shallowly ascending Goat Ridge to an unnamed pass where the Lily Basin
        trail begins.

      <p>
        From the pass you can view a majority of the traverse through Lily Basin
        beneath the Goat Rocks themselves. The weather was 10/10 on this day I
        don't think it went above 75 degress.

      <p>
        I ditched my pack here, grabbed a water bottle and headed up to Hawkeye
        Point.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hawkeye Point from below. There were actually lots hawks circling the
        area. Go figure.

        Looking back at a tangential unnamed ridge with stupendous rock
        formations. I traversed this ridge shortly after.

      <p>
        At Hawkeye Point, Goat Lake comes into view. There were bowls of nails
        and iron rods sticking out of the rocks here, maybe remnants of an old
        structure. I met a man who gave me a gummy bear.

        This was also one of the many points where you could see 3
        stratavolcanos.

        I wanted to scramble the ridge around the lake but there was a sheer
        cliff after Hawkeye that you would probably want to rappel down.

        This ridge in the opposite direction was much more accessible, headed
        there next. Still only packing a water bottle here so I did some
        trailrunning.

      <p>
        At this point I had completed most of my itenerary for the first day. I
        don't think it was even noon yet. I had seen tons of campsites already
        so I decided to throw out my itenerary and do whatever, at no particular
        pace. I wasn't even sure if I was going to complete the entire loop,
        since the last half of my intended route was mostly through low lying
        forest, which just wasn't as interesting as the core region. I just had
        a few of goals in mind:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Knife Edge PCT section</li>
        <li>Old Snowy Mountain</li>
        <li>Goat Rocks main ridge scramble</li>
        <li>Snowgrass Flats</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Shortly after this I decided to set up camp either around Goat Lake
        pending crowds or a bit further in Lily Basin. Then if I had enough time
        I would hike up to the ridge and trail run the Knife Edge, come back
        down and end the day.
      </p>
      <p>So now heading down into the basin to set up camp.</p>

        class="post-image"

      <p>These rock formations were otherworldly.</p>

      <p>
        There were tons of flowers in this section. I think this was past peak
        bloom but I'm definitely going to visit next year in early July,
        probably for a day hike.

        Found a nice wooded campsite and looked back at the traverse. Hawkeye
        point and the basin containing Goat Lake are in the image below.

        At this point I set up camp, ate lunch, and took a nap. The rest of the
        day I had a very light pack with just some water, snacks and some safety
        essentials. I started up the ridge toward Old Snowy Mountain around 2pm
        to check out the Knife Edge PCT section. From my campsite I went back
        toward Goat Lake maybe a quarter mile and turned right onto a trail that
        ascended sharply to the east. This trail for some reason was not on my
        paper map but was visible on Caltopo.

        The vegetation quickly faded and gave way to boulders and talus. There
        was some trivial route finding up to the ridge.

        Meeting up with the PCT here. I think this was my first time on the PCT.
        I started to see a steady stream of weathered thru hikers moving north.
        I dropped my pack here and continued with just a water bottle.

        This trail is so badass. Panoramic views and almost sheer cliffs on both
        sides.

        I scrambled one of the peaks on this section, but it was absolute crap
        choss and I got stuck in a class 4 section on the way down. Do not
        recommend. At least got this sick shot with some bird action.

        So ends day 1, with some mid-ass Teriyaki MRE that I probably could have
        eaten two of. Absolute banger of a day though. Sometimes backpacking
        trips can be a bit dull when you have to do longer distances and have
        your pack on all day. It was very refreshing to just hang out in one
        area and do a bunch of different activites. I was completely exhausted
        though, clocking 15 miles and 6000 feet of vert, with some trail
        running. Slept like a baby.
