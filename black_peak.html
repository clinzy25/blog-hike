      <p>
        I scrambled Black Peak on Sunday August 24 2025, car-to-car via the Wing
        Lake trail. This was my first step into more technical mountaineering
        and my first Bulger summit. For reference, the hardest thing I have
        climbed was Class 2, so I wasn't sure if I would be able to hang in the
        Class 3 - 4 range on this one, but I am happy to report that I did
        summit and gained a new confidence in my climbing abilities in the
        process.
      </p>
      <h2>Diablo Lake</h2>
      <p>
        The day before the climb I picked up a rental car and headed out to
        paddle Diablo Lake. Due to bad logistics I ended up getting there late
        around 7pm, but still had some daylight left to go out on the water.
        I've driven by this lake far too many times without stopping to properly
        take it in, always on a time crunch, or too tired. I made amends over a
        beer on it's distinctive turquiose waters, which I learned is caused by
        glaciers grinding rocks into fine
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_flour">glacial flour</a>
        that stays suspended in the lake.

        I can't wait to come back here with more time and explore some of the
        islands and inlets. On this day I was forced back to shore by darkness,
        and I ended the day with a poke bowl at the lookout above the lake, and
        a 30 minute drive to the Maple Pass trailhead where I spent the night in
        the car.
      </p>
      <h2>The Approach</h2>
      <p>
        I hit the trail the next day at 6am and hiked 2.2 miles up to Heather
        pass with the sunrise. This is a popular and well maintained section of
        trail that rises gradually up the ridge above Ann Lake.
      </p>

      <p>
        At Heather Pass there is a junction where the Black Peak climbers trail
        begins, cutting north across a short section of open meadows. This is
        where Black Peak reveals itself for the first time.
      </p>

      <p>
        After the meadows you can look down upon the entire approach. The actual
        trail goes off to the right of the image below, though you can also
        traverse the boulder field which is what I opted to do.
      </p>
      <img

      <p>
        After descending gradually and mountain-goating across huge boulders for
        about a mile you'll reach Lewis Lake at the lowest point of the
        approach. More glacial flour here lends to the a beautiful turquoise
        color that I got a much better shot of in the full afternoon sun.
      </p>
      <img
        src="https://clinzy-blog-assts.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1756854345707-20250824_073733.jpg"

        alt="20250824_073733.jpg"
      />
      <p>
        This is where the ascent begins. The trail here looks like it follows a
        dry creek bed up a hill, but it actually curves around the west end of
        the lake before continuing up. If you find yourself bushwacking or
        stepping over large wood debris at any point on this approach, you're
        probably off trail. The section between Lewis Lake and Wing Lake is a
        constant but gradual ascent and I found myself repeatedly turning around
        to look at the range as it opened up behind me. It also started to get
        hot at this point.
      </p>

      <p>
        Arriving at Wing Lake the vegitation diminishes and Black Peak looms
        overhead. There were quite a few people camping here, maybe 5 or 6
        parties. Some I could already see making their way up the scree slope. I
        stopped here to fill up on water and eat a candy bar before starting to
        the actual climb.

      <h2>The Climb</h2>
      <p>
        The climb begins with a long and very steep scree pitch up to the south
        saddle. If you are unfamilar with PNW scree, you will certainly get to
        know it here. It's almost like climbing up snow. I have to agree with
        some other reports that claimed this was the hardest part of the climb.
        My map shows grades of up to 80% toward the top. I was very thankful for
        the clouds that rolled in at this point and remained there for most of
        the climb, taking the edge off the heat.

        The saddle to the false summit was very fun and comfortable Class 3
        scrambling. Many different paths are available and none too exposed or
        technical. I chose to stay close to the many bluffs and ridges where I
        could work with solid rock and avoid the annoying talus / scree mixture
        that accumulates in the gullys. Here I began to see most of the rock
        covered with a dry black lichen that I assume the peak is named for. It
        did not inhibit climbing.

      <p>
        From the false summit, the true summit is in view, and as you get closer
        you will start to see potential routes up. These all appear to be Class
        5 and above but the main scrambling route is not obvious here. It is
        important at this point to continue
        <em>around the summit block to the right</em>, all the way to the east
        side of it. You'll start seeing more exposure as you move around the
        summit block, but you are mostly walking horizontally on narrow paths
        and ledges. You'll know when to stop when you hit a sheer cliff dropping
        to the north from a kind of saddle with the summit on your left and a
        lesser peak to your right. At this point, you can go no further, and
        looking up and to the left you will see the Class 4 section of the
        route.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was anxious for this section as I have never dealt with Class 4
        exposure, but as soon as I laid hands on the rock, it just felt like
        another day at the gym. The holds were good, and the 3 moves were
        probably no higher than v2, each requiring a fair amount of commitment.
        I found the section well within my capabilities as a climber, but of
        course outside of my comfort zone in terms of exposure. It's worth
        noting I don't think a fall here would be necessarily fatal, as you
        would probably land on the saddle no more than 50 feet below, which is
        likely what makes it a Class 4 instead of a Class 5 pitch. In retrospect
        I think this was a perfect level of challenge/risk for me at my current
        level.
      </p>
      <p>
        I only have footage of this section after the downclimb so going a bit
        out of order here.

      <h2>The Summit</h2>
      <p>
        I aquired the summit at about 10:30 am, much earlier than I anticipated.
        The views were insane. Glacier, Baker, Goode, Formidable, and several
        other Bulger peaks were visible. Layer upon layer of mountain ranges
        stretched out in every direction.

        A pair of climbers ascended from the northeast ridge and met me on the
        summit shortly after I arrived.

        Maybe it was adrenaline or the cool weather but I was suprisingly not
        feeling too bad at this point.

        In this image you can see most of the approach. From the top-left,
        Heather pass -> boulder field -> Lewis Lake -> Wing Lake -> scree slope.

      <h2>The Descent</h2>
      <p>
        Descending the Class 4 section was the most uncomfortable part of the
        climb, but it was not too difficult. The rest of the Class 3 section
        between there and and the saddle was very much choose your own adventure
        and I made no real effort to follow the same route I went up.
      </p>

      <p>
        The scree slope descent was absolutely heinous. I kindof just slid down
        it. The video below is one of the more tame sections.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the end of the scree slope, I started to feel pretty worked, with
        some knee pain from the descent. It was also at this point I remembered
        I had to <em>ascend</em> the mile long boulder field this time, so I
        decided to chill at Wing Lake for a while, go for a swim and slam a
        double decker turkey sandwich.
      </p>
      <p>
        The swim was definitely a moment for me. Something about getting the
        wind knocked out of you by freezing cold glacier water, smack underneath
        gigantic mountain I just climbed, felt like a baptism. I was baptized at
        9 years old by a priest, but needless to say, this one was far more
        meaningful. This time, the mountain was my priest, and my mission
        henceforth as decreed by the mountain gods was to go out into the world,
        and with all the love and grace bestowed upon me by the creator, smash
        every fucking Bulger, as it is written.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sadly this beautiful moment was cut short by my leg muscles seizing up
        from the cold so I had limp-swim back to shore.

        The boulder field ascent ruined me. I got back to the car around 3pm
        feeling positively wrecked. I can't understate the significance of this
        trip for myself. I discovered I was capable of a whole new set of
        experiences that I wasnt sure I was ready for. Now I am already planning
        my next climb. I am hoping that the Pomas Fire clears up before the end
        of the season and I can tackle Mount Maude and 7FJ.
